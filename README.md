# GameLanding

This is a simple static landing page for your Game Server.

It was originally created for one Minecraft Server, which unfortunately vanished, so I've decided to publish it.

## Getting ready

### Requirements

- Node.js

### Installing dependencies

```shell
$ npm install
```

### Building CSS

You need to build the CSS file, which is a simple task.

```shell
$ npm run css-build
```

## Customizing

You can customize the template all you want.

### Customizing colors

Take a look at styles/main.scss and modify the variables to your needs.

Once you are done, don't forget to recompile the CSS file. (see [Building CSS](#building-css))
